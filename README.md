Reinforced Walls 0.15.1 by Michael Cowgill (ChurchOrganist)

This is my first attempt at a [Factorio](http://www.factorio.com/) mod. 

It adds some upgraded wall types to your base defence system.

This has been tested in sandbox mode and can be researched built and placed.

Currently there are 3 types which you can research.

1. Reinforced Wall with double hitpoints.
2. Acid Resist Wall which adds acid resistance to enhanced physical resistance.
3. Damage Reflect Wall which reflects back damage onto the attacking biter in addition to Acid Resistance and enhanced physical resistance.
